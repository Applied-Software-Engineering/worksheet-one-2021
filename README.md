# Worksheet One

## An introduction to `JavaScript` in preparation for `Node.js`

On the <https://www.learn-js.org> site complete the following sections/exercises:

1. [Hello, World!](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
2. [Variables and Types](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Variables_and_Types)
3. [Arrays](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Arrays)
4. [Manipulating Arrays](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Manipulating_Arrays)
5. [Operators](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Operators)
6. [Conditions](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Conditions)
7. [Loops](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Loops)
8. [Objects](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Objects)
9. [Functions](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Functions)
10. [Pop-up Boxes](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Pop-up_Boxes)
11. [Callbacks](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Callbacks)


The advantage of using `Learn-js.org` is that you do not have to install any software. 
You should copy you answers into files on your repository and then `push` them to `GitHub` - 
in that way we can monitor the progress you are making.

If you wish you may complete the remaining sections/exercises - they will form part of the 
next worksheet anyway.
